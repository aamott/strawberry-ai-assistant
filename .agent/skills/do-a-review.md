description: Quick checklist for creating/updating a review in ./docs/reviews.
---

1) Open (or create) a review file in `./docs/reviews` named with today’s date.
2) For each finding, add a checklist item containing **Title, Type (bug/refactor/logging/perf/etc.), Priority, Difficulty, Applicable folders/filepaths,** and a clear description of the required change.
3) Update the review continuously as you discover issues; don’t wait until the end.
4) Watch for: outdated docs, bugs, redundant or low-quality code, overly complex or tightly coupled architecture, and oversized files.
5) Use Mermaid (no abbreviations) if a diagram helps; follow it with a plain-language explanation.
