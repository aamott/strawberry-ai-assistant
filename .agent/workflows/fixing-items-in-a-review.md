description: Use this when going through items in a review and fixing or implementing them.
---

Reviews are like TODO lists. Check an item off when you've fixed it or implemented it. Delete the file if it's all checked off. Periodically, delete checked off items from the file. 

1. Choose reviewed items to fix or implement. If an item will impact other items, consider fixing it first. Otherwise, go through the simplest items first.
2. Run tests as you make changes. If they fail, go back and fix the issue. Fix any warnings that appear. 
3. Run ruff check periodically to ensure code quality.
