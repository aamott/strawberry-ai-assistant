description: Use these instructions when doing a code or architecture review.
---

1. Reviews are stored in `./docs/reviews`. Treat them like a detailed todo list. Each review item should include: 
- Title
- Checkbox
- Priority
- Difficulty
- Applicable Folders/Filepaths
- Description/what needs to change. 

2. Reviews may include anything from architecture to docstrings to code improvements or fixes. 
3. Write or update the review as you discover things. Don't save it all up until the end.

If you use diagrams, use Mermaid, but don't abbreviate components in the diagram - that makes it hard to read if the reader doesn't have a markdown renderer.
